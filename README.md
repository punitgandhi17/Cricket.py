# Cricket.py
Cricket.PY is a simple yet fun terminal-based cricket game where the goal is to score as many runs as possible without matching the computer's number. You’ll be out if your chosen run (between 0 and 6) matches the computer’s random number. Try your luck, beat the odds, and chase your high score!
